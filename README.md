## **Description of the Use Case**

In today's digital age, individuals often receive a large volume of messages across various messaging platforms, making it challenging to stay organized and on top of important information. This project aims to address this issue by developing a Personal Assistant that consolidates messages from multiple sources into a unified, digestible format. The user can specify and set preferences on how they want the information to be curated. They can choose between receiving updates on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis (essentially different time periods). 

The target users for this project are professionals, students, or anyone who juggles multiple communication channels and struggles to keep track of important updates, deadlines, or actionable items buried within their messages. By providing a centralized solution, our Personal Assistant streamlines the process of staying informed and organized, ultimately enhancing productivity and reducing the risk of missing critical information.

## **Key Functionalities**

1. **Multi-Platform Integration**: The Personal Assistant connects to various messaging platforms (currently supporting Slack and Outlook), allowing users to consolidate their communications in one place.
2. **Daily Summaries**: The system generates concise summaries of incoming messages, highlighting important information and actionable items (calendar events). These summaries will be presented in a user-friendly format, making it easy for users to quickly grasp the key points without having to sift through individual messages.
3. **Large Language Model (LLM) Integration**: The Personal Assistant leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate coherent summaries. Multiple LLMs will be available to the user. 
4. **Flexible Summary Periods**: Users have the option to generate summaries for different time periods, in addition to daily summaries. This flexibility allows users to tailor the system to their specific needs and preferences.
6. **User Interface**: The Personal Assistant provides a user-friendly mobile app interface, allowing users to easily access their message summaries and configure their preferences.
